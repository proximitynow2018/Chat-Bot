# Chat Bot
**Chat Bot** is a batch file I created when you are tottaly and utterly bored.
## Setup
All you have to do is download **Chat Bot** folder and run Setup.bat then you can run Chat Bot.bat
## Speechpacks
So I have made it so you guys can customize your very own speechpack for this project the instructions on how are stated below.
1. Goto the speech folder
2. Make a copy of **template**
3. Rename it to whatever you want
4. Open the **sayings.speeches** file
5. In there you will see **blank** delete **blank** and put the actions you want your chat bot to do line-by-line
6. Save and close that file
7. See where it says **blank.speech** copy that to how many words or lines you have in **sayings.speeches**
8. Name them to the phrases you used in **sayings.speeches**
9. In each one put in what you want the bot to say in that state
10. Close and save that file
11. Open the **user** folder
12. Repeat steps 7 and 8 but in the **user** folder
13. In these files is what the user has to say to trigger what the bot will respond.
14. After that go back to the root folder and run **Setup.bat**
15. Fill it out but as the speechpack put the name what you named your folder
16. Have fun
If you had trouble then I will be making a video if that's what you guys want
